**Introduction:**  
At the core of text editing is the **caret** (the blinking insertion point) that indicates where text appears as you type. Mastering both the basic and advanced shortcuts across all text editing tasks—from navigation and selection to clipboard operations, undo/redo, and formatting—will dramatically boost your efficiency. Each category below features an “Advanced” section with extra shortcuts and tips available in many modern editors.

|Alt + Left/Right (in browsers)|Navigate backward or forward through text editing history or previous states (in some apps)|Quickly return to a previous text state or location|

_Tip:_ In many advanced editors, additional plugins or settings can further enhance navigation (for example, jump-to-definition in coding environments).
